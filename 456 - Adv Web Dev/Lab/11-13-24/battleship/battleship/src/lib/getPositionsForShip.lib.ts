/**
 * Generates the list of positions for a ship based on its type, starting position, and orientation.
 * The function calculates the positions the ship would occupy on the board and checks if they are valid.
 * If the positions are valid, it returns them; otherwise, 
 * it throws an `InvalidPositionError`.
 *
 * @function getPositionsForShip
 * @param {GameBoard} board - The current game board, which contains both players' grids.
 * @param {Player} player - The player who is placing the ship (either "player1" or "player2").
 * @param {Ship} ship - The ship to be placed, containing its type and size (number of spaces).
 * @param {PositionType} position - The starting position where the ship's first tile will be placed.
 * @param {OrientationType} orientation - The orientation of the ship (either "HORIZONTAL" or "VERTICAL").
 * @returns {PositionType[]} An array of positions the ship will occupy on the board.
 * @throws {InvalidPositionError} If the calculated positions are invalid (e.g., out of bounds or overlapping another ship).
 *
 * @example
 * // Example of getting valid positions for a ship
 * const ship = buildShip(ShipType.CARRIER, OrientationType.HORIZONTAL);
 * const position = { x: 0, y: 0 };
 * const positions = getPositionsForShip(board, "player1", ship, position, OrientationType.HORIZONTAL);
 * console.log(positions);
 * // Output: [{ x: 0, y: 0 }, { x: 1, y: 0 }, { x: 2, y: 0 }, { x: 3, y: 0 }, { x: 4, y: 0 }]
