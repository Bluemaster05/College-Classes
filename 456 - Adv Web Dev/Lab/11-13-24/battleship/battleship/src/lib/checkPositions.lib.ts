/**
 * Checks whether a ship can be placed at the specified positions on the game board 
 * for the given player, taking into account the ship's orientation (horizontal or vertical).
 * The function ensures that the ship fits within the bounds of the 10x10 grid and does not overlap with another ship.
 *
 * @function checkPositions
 * @param {GameBoard} board - The current game board, which includes both players' data.
 * @param {Player} player - The player whose ship placement is being checked (either "player1" or "player2").
 * @param {PositionType[]} positions - An array of `PositionType` objects representing the positions where the ship is attempting to be placed.
 * @returns {boolean} `true` if the ship can be placed at the specified positions; `false` otherwise.
 *
 * @example
 * // Example of checking if a Cruiser can be placed horizontally at positions [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0)]
 * const canPlace = checkPositions(gameBoard, "player1", ship, OrientationType.HORIZONTAL, [{ x: 0, y: 0 }, { x: 1, y: 0 }, { x: 2, y: 0 }]);
 * console.log(canPlace); // true or false depending on the current state of the board
